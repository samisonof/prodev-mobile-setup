# prodev-mobile-setup with Expo Go

## Objective
Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web development. To simplify development and testing, we are using the **Expo Framework** for React Native.  
Expo Go allows us to test React Native apps directly on physical devices without the need for heavy emulators or multiple test devices.

---

## Prerequisites
Before setting up Expo Go, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/) ✅
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ✅
- A compatible OS (macOS, Linux, or Windows) ✅
- A physical Android or iOS device ✅

---

## Why Expo Go?
- Emulators require heavy hardware resources.  
- Maintaining different versions of simulators (e.g., iPhone 7 → iPhone 16 Pro Max, and many Android models) is resource intensive.  
- **Expo Go** provides a lightweight solution by running React Native apps directly on your phone.  
- Works seamlessly on both **Android** and **iOS**.
